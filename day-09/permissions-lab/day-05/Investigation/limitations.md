# Analytical Limitations & Evidence Integrity

## Data Gaps Identified
1. **Lack of Payload Visibility:** Without deep packet inspection or PCAP data, application-layer intent cannot be verified.
2. **Absence of Host Telemetry:** Network sockets lack correlation to local operating system process IDs (PIDs).
3. **No Temporal Baseline:** A 10-record snapshot provides no historical context regarding normal versus anomalous behavior for this training endpoint.

## Core Rule of Analysis
*"Observations represent ground truth; interpretations are testable hypotheses; conclusions must never exceed the bounds of supporting evidence."*
